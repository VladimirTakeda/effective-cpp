# Local Max

## Problem

Implement template function `LocalMax` in `local_max.h`, which returns iterator to the first element in the sequence `[first, last)`, such
as it is strictly greater than it's neighbors. Return `last` in case there is no such element.

You may expect, that iterators here are at least `bidirectional`.

Use only `operator<` for comparing elements.
